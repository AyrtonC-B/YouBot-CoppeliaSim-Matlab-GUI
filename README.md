# KUKA YouBot
This repo provides a way for a person to run a virtual Kuka YouBot in Coppelia sim and use the provided MatLab program to spin up a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to control the virtual robot remotely. This code could in theory control a real Kuka Youbot should it be configured like it is in CoppeliaSim.
